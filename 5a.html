            <h1>Santa Claus</h1>
                <p>Santa Claus, otherwise known as Saint Nicholas or Kris Kringle, has a long history steeped 
                in Christmas traditions.Today, he is thought of mainly as the jolly man in red who brings toys to 
                good girls and boys on Christmas Eve, but his story stretches all the way back to the 3rd century, 
                when Saint Nicholas walked the earth and became the patron saint of children. 
                Find out more about the history of Santa Claus from his earliest origins to the shopping mall 
                Santas of today, and discover how two New Yorkers, Clement Clark Moore and Thomas Nast, 
                were major influences on the Santa Claus millions of children wait for each Christmas Eve.</p>

        <h2 class="title">The Legend of St. Nicholas: The Real Santa Claus</h2>

        <div class="section">
            <p>The legend of Santa Claus can be traced back hundreds of years to a monk named St. Nicholas. 
            It is believed that Nicholas was born sometime around A.D. 280 in Patara, near Myra in modern-day Turkey. 
            Much admired for his piety and kindness, St. Nicholas became the subject of many legends. 
            It is said that he gave away all of his inherited wealth and traveled the countryside helping the poor and sick. 
            One of the best-known St. Nicholas stories is the time he saved three poor sisters from being sold into 
            slavery or prostitution by their father by providing them with a dowry so that they could be married.
            Over the course of many years, Nicholas’s popularity spread and he became known as the protector of children and sailors.
            His feast day is celebrated on the anniversary of his death, December 6. This was traditionally considered a lucky day
            to make large purchases or to get married. By the Renaissance, St. Nicholas was the most popular saint in Europe. 
            Even after the Protestant Reformation, when the veneration of saints began to be discouraged, St. Nicholas 
            maintained a positive reputation, especially in Holland.</p>

        <h2 class="title">Sinter Klaas Comes to New York</h2>

        <div class="section">
            <p>St. Nicholas made his first inroads into American popular culture towards the end of the 18th century. 
            In December 1773, and again in 1774, a New York newspaper reported that groups of Dutch families had 
            gathered to honor the anniversary of his death.The name Santa Claus evolved from Nick’s Dutch nickname, 
            Sinter Klaas, a shortened form of Sint Nikolaas (Dutch for Saint Nicholas).In 1804, John Pintard, 
            a member of the New York Historical Society, distributed woodcuts of St. Nicholas at the society’s annual meeting.
            The background of the engraving contains now-familiar Santa images including stockings filled 
            with toys and fruit hung over a fireplace. In 1809, Washington Irving helped to popularize the Sinter 
            Klaas stories when he referred to St. Nicholas as the patron saint of New York in his book, The History of New York. 
            As his prominence grew, Sinter Klaas was described as everything from a “rascal” with a blue 
            three-cornered hat, red waistcoat, and yellow stockings to a man wearing a broad-brimmed 
            hat and a “huge pair of Flemish trunk hose.”</p>

        <h2 class="title">Shopping Mall Santas</h2>

        <div class="section">
            <p>Gift-giving, mainly centered around children, has been an important part of the Christmas celebration 
            since the holiday’s rejuvenation in the early 19th century. Stores began to advertise Christmas 
            shopping in 1820, and by the 1840s, newspapers were creating separate sections for holiday advertisements, 
            which often featured images of the newly-popular Santa Claus.
            In 1841, thousands of children visited a Philadelphia shop to see a life-size Santa Claus model.
             It was only a matter of time before stores began to attract children, and their parents, with the 
             lure of a peek at a “live” Santa Claus. In the early 1890s, the Salvation Army needed money to 
             pay for the free Christmas meals they provided to needy families. They began dressing up unemployed 
             men in Santa Claus suits and sending them into the streets of New York to solicit donations. 
             Those familiar Salvation Army Santas have been ringing bells on the street corners of American cities ever since.
             Perhaps the most iconic department store Santa is Kris Kringle in the 1947 classic Santa Claus 
            movie “Miracle on 34 Street.” A young Natalie Wood played a little girl who believes Kris Kringle 
            (played by Edmund Gwenn, who won an Oscar for the role) when he says he is the real Santa Claus.
             “Miracle on 34 Street” was remade in 1994 and starred Lord Richard Attenborough and Mara Wilson.
             The Macy’s Santa has appeared at almost every Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade since it began in 
            1924, and fans of all ages still line up to meet the Macy’s Santa in New York City and at stores 
            around the country, where children can take pictures on Santa’s lap and tell him what they want for Christmas.</p>

        <h2 class="title">‘Twas the Night Before Christmas</h2>

        <div class="section">
            <p>In 1822, Clement Clarke Moore, an Episcopal minister, wrote a long Christmas poem for his three daughters 
            entitled “An Account of a Visit from St. Nicholas,” more popularly known as “‘Twas The Night Before Christmas.” 
            Moore’s poem, which he was initially hesitant to publish due to the frivolous nature of its subject, 
            is largely responsible for our modern image of Santa Claus as a “right jolly old elf” with a portly 
            figure and the supernatural ability to ascend a chimney with a mere nod of his head! Although 
            some of Moore’s imagery was probably borrowed from other sources, his poem helped popularize the 
            now-familiar image of a Santa Claus who flew from house to house on Christmas Eve in “a miniature sleigh” led 
            by eight flying reindeer to leave presents for deserving children. “An Account of a Visit from St. Nicholas” 
            created a new and immediately popular American icon. In 1881, political cartoonist Thomas Nast 
            drew on Moore’s poem to create the first likeness that matches our modern image of Santa Claus. 
            His cartoon, which appeared in Harper’s Weekly, depicted Santa as a rotund, cheerful man with a full, 
            white beard, holding a sack laden with toys for lucky children. It is Nast who gave Santa his bright 
            red suit trimmed with white fur, North Pole workshop, elves and his wife, Mrs. Claus.</p>

        <h2 class="title">Santa Claus Around the World </h2>

        <div class="section">
            <p>Eighteenth-century America’s Santa Claus was not the only St. Nicholas-inspired gift-giver 
            to make an appearance at Christmastime. There are similar figures and Christmas traditions around the world. 
            Christkind or Kris Kringle was believed to deliver presents to well-behaved Swiss and German children. 
            Meaning “Christ child,” Christkind is an angel-like figure often accompanied by St. Nicholas on his holiday 
            missions. In Scandinavia, a jolly elf named Jultomten was thought to deliver gifts in a sleigh drawn by goats. 
            English legend explains that Father Christmas visits each home on Christmas Eve to fill children’s stockings 
            with holiday treats. Père Noël is responsible for filling the shoes of French children. In Italy, there is a 
            story of a woman called La Befana, a kindly witch who rides a broomstick down the chimneys of Italian homes to 
            deliver toys into the stockings of lucky children.</p>

        <h2 class="title">Christmas Traditions in the United States</h2> 

        <div class="section">   
            <p>In the United States, Santa Claus is often depicted as flying from his home to home on Christmas Eve 
            to deliver toys to children. He flies on his magic sleigh led by his reindeer: Dasher, Dancer, 
            Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen, and the most famous reindeer of all, Rudolph. 
            Santa enters each home through the chimney, which is why empty Christmas stockings—once empty socks, 
            now often dedicated stockings made for the occasion—are “hung by the Chimney with care, in hopes that 
            St. Nicholas soon would be there,” as Clement Clarke Moore wrote in his famous poem. Stockings can 
            be filled with candy canes and other treats or small toys.Santa Claus and his wife, Mrs. Claus, 
            call the North Pole home, and children write letters to Santa and track Santa’s progress around the world on Christmas Eve. 
            Children often leave cookies and milk for Santa and carrots for his reindeer on Christmas Eve. 
            Santa Claus keeps a “naughty list” and a “nice list” to determine who deserves gifts on Christmas 
            morning, and parents often invoke these lists as a way to ensure their children are on their best behavior. 
            The lists are immortalized in the 1934 Christmas song “Santa Claus is coming to Town”:</p>  
        </div>

        <h2 class="title">The Ninth Reindeer, Rudolph</h2> 
            
        <div class="section">  
            <p>Rudolph, “the most famous reindeer of all,” was born over 100 years after his eight flying counterparts. 
                The red-nosed wonder was the creation of Robert L. May, a copywriter at the Montgomery Ward department store.
                In 1939, May wrote a Christmas-themed story-poem to help bring holiday traffic into his store. 
                Using a similar rhyme pattern to Moore’s “‘Twas the Night Before Christmas,” May told the story of Rudolph, 
                a young reindeer who was teased by the other deer because of his large, glowing, red nose. 
                But, When Christmas Eve turned foggy and Santa worried that he wouldn’t be able to deliver gifts that night, 
                the former outcast saved Christmas by leading the sleigh by the light of his red nose. 
                Rudolph’s message—that given the opportunity, a liability can be turned into an asset—proved popular.
                Montgomery Ward sold almost two and a half million copies of the story in 1939. 
                When it was reissued in 1946, the book sold over three and half million copies. 
                Several years later, one of May’s friends, Johnny Marks, wrote a short song based on Rudolph’s story (1949). 
                It was recorded by Gene Autry and sold over two million copies. Since then, the story has been 
                translated into 25 languages and been made into a television movie, narrated by Burl Ives, 
                which has charmed audiences every year since 1964.</p>
